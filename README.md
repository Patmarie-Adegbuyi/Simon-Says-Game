# Simon-Says-Game
This is code to recreate a version of the game 'Simon Says' using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The Single-Player Simon Says Game is as follows:
•	Click the START button to begin, the game status indicator (the red/green light below the START button) switches from RED to GREEN. The game will begin 3s after the light turns GREEN.
•	Simon will give the first signal (randomly flash a coloured button). Repeat the signal by clicking the same colour button.
•	Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by clicking the same colour buttons, in order.
•	Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.
•	Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.
•	If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds by flashing all four buttons simultaneously. This means you have lost, and the sequence of signals ends. The game status indicator switches from GREEN to RED and you will have to click START button to begin a new game.
